# Qualcomm-Atheros-QCA6174 #
For some reason, Ubuntu 14.04+ refuses to recognize the Atheros QCA6x74 WNIC. This is the fix (sourced from Anunay on askubuntu)[http://askubuntu.com/questions/662172/problem-with-wireless-driver-on-ubuntu-15-04-and-lenovo-z51-70].

#### THE FIX ####
* First download the files and extract.
* Then:
```
chmod a+x WNIC.sh
./WNIC.sh
```
* FINISHED!
